# Machine-learning-based-TENG-noise-detection
##Introduction
Nowadays,TENGs are more and more popular used in medical sensor industry.However,TENG sensors are very sensitive to noise,so how to remove the noise is extreamly important. Basically,we have two kinds of methods,software and hardware.For hardware method,we design filters,amplifier and etc. For software method,we design machine learning algorithm to reduce noise.
